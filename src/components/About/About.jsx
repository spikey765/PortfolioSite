            <p>
              Hi there! I'm Taimor, a penultimate year CS student at the University of Manchester, an aspiring Software Engineer and Data Science enthusiast. 
            </p>   
            <p>
              With a strong background in computer science, I thrive in agile, collaborative work environments where I can apply my skills in software development and data analysis.
              I enjoy the challenge that comes with solving complex problems and often explore problems from multiple angles to properly plan my approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion primarily lies in software engineering, where I have experience in full-stack development, from various hackathons to personal projects.
              Always willing to adapt, I've worked with various technologies across the stack based on project requirements and team needs. </p>
            <p>  
              Whether it's building user-friendly interfaces or laying the foundational backend systems, I enjoy the entire software development lifecycle in its entirety.
              For frontend development, I have a strong preference for React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS, while for backend development, I have experience with Node.js, Express.js and Python Flask for machine-learning based projects.
              I'm also comfortable with databases like Supabase and PostgreSQL, and I have a keen interest in cloud technologies, particularly AWS.
            </p>
            <p>
              My projects cover a range of real-world applications, from developing an engaging social party game for students to get creative with to addressing real world problems using AI in the fields of photojournalism and strength training.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of academics, I enjoy swimming, padel and travelling to explore new cultures and places. These activities help me maintain a healthy work-life balance and bring fresh perspectives to my work.
            </p>
